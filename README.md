Create your accounts, add or remove money from 	your accounts, transfer money between accounts, check your account and other options. Main menu provides you 	option to choose between:

1. Entering the bank (which is bank worker point of view) where you can open and remove account, depose, pay out 	from your account, check your balance. 
2. Using ATM machine (which is user point of view) where you can manage transactions using card pin code, but 	cannot open new account or removing existing account using ATM machine.
